    <h1>Proxy Monitor</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Proxy Monitor is a small application that monitors the network and auto-detects the
        internet proxy server to use.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="Images/NotificationIcon.png" alt="Proxy Monitor Notification Icon" /></p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Before this application can be used, the .NET Framework Version 2.0 must be installed.
        It is available for free at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx"
            target="_blank">Microsoft's download page for the .NET Framework</a>.</p>
    <p>The application can be installed by just copying it to a destination directory of
        your choice. Uninstalling is just a matter of deleting the files again – there are
        no registry settings or other external items that are modified by the application.</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>The application can be started as a regular application, which will make it run as
        an icon in the system notification area. When started, it will auto-detect the proxy
        server to use. It will also automatically re-detect the proxy server when the computer’s
        network address has changed.</p>
    <p>You can right-click the icon to manually set the proxy server or to trigger an auto-detection.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="Images/MenuItems.png" alt="Proxy Monitor Menu" /></p>
    <p>The application can also be run from the command-line with the /detect flag to auto-detect
        the proxy and exit immediately (e.g. when the computer starts up).</p>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>The application must be configured to include the definitions of the known proxy
        servers. This involves changing the ProxyMonitor.exe.config file in a text editor
        to list all known proxy servers in the <code>&lt;proxyServers&gt;</code> element.</p>
    <p>Each proxy server must be represented as a <code>&lt;proxyServer&gt;</code> element
        with the following attributes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>name</code>: the friendly name of the proxy server. This will show up in the
            context menu of the application icon in the notification area.</li>
        <li><code>host</code>: the IP-address or host name of the proxy server.</li>
        <li><code>port</code>: the TCP port to use on the proxy server (defaults to port 80).</li>
        <li><code>bypassForLocalAddresses</code>: set to true to bypass the proxy server for
            local addresses, or false to always use the proxy server (defaults to true).</li>
        <li><code>bypassList</code>: set to true to bypass the proxy server for local addresses,
            or false to always use the proxy server (defaults to true).</li>
        <li><code>autoConfigUrl</code>: set this to the url of an automatic proxy configuration
            script, if available.</li>
        <li><code>command</code>: the command (DOS command, batch file, ...) to execute if this
            proxy is used.</li>
        <li><code>skipAutoDetect</code>: skips auto-detection of this proxy server, so that
            it only can be set manually through the context menu.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Only the <code>name</code> and either the <code>host</code> or <code>autoConfigUrl</code>
        attributes are mandatory.</p>
    <p>Each proxy server is in checked to see if it is available by attempting to download
        the <code>autoConfigUrl</code> or by sending a ping command to the <code>host</code>.
        When the download succeeded or a reply is received, the proxy server will be used
        and optionally the <code>command</code> is executed. If needed, the ping timeout
        value can be modified in the <code>pingTimeout</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;proxyConfiguration&gt;</code>
        element (the default is 1000 milliseconds).</p>
    <p>It is also possible to disable all proxy change notifications (balloon tips) by setting
        the <code>disableNotifications</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;proxyConfiguration&gt;</code>
        element to <code>true</code> (the default is <code>false</code>). </p>
    <p>A sample configuration file looks as follows:</p>
    <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;configSections&gt;
    &lt;section name="proxyConfiguration"
      type="JelleDruyts.ProxyMonitor.Configuration.ProxyConfiguration, ProxyMonitor"/&gt;
  &lt;/configSections&gt;
  &lt;proxyConfiguration pingTimeout="1000" disableNotifications="false"&gt;
    &lt;proxyServers&gt;
      &lt;proxyServer name="Home"
        host="homeproxy"
        port="8080" 
        bypassForLocalAddresses="false"
        skipAutoDetect="false" /&gt;
      &lt;proxyServer name="Work"
        autoConfigUrl="http://workproxy/autoconfig.pac"
        bypassForLocalAddresses="true" 
        bypassList="server1;server2"
        command="ConnectToShares.bat"
        skipAutoDetect="false" /&gt;
    &lt;/proxyServers&gt;
  &lt;/proxyConfiguration&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>
    <h2>What's New?</h2>
    <h2>v1.2 (08/09/2008)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the <code>skipAutoDetect</code> attribute to support proxies that are only
            set manually.</li>
        <li>Fixed the bug where Interet Explorer would override the proxy settings again (at
            random) to their previous values.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v1.1.0 (11/09/2007)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the <code>bypassList</code> attribute to support the proxy bypass list.</li>
        <li>Added the <code>disableNotifications</code> attribute to allow disabling notifications
            (balloon tips).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v1.0.60905 (05/09/2006)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The configured proxy servers are now checked in parallel to speed up proxy detection.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v1.0.60807 (07/08/2006)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A custom command can now be executed when the proxy server is set.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v1.0.60805 (05/08/2006)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Besides pinging the <code>host</code>, the <code>autoConfigUrl</code> attribute
            of the <code>proxyServer</code> element is now used to determine if the proxy server
            is reachable by attempting a download of the configuration script.</li>
        <li>As a result, the <code>host</code> attribute of the <code>proxyServer</code> element
            is now optional.</li>
        <li>When starting the application with the /detect flag to auto-detect the proxy server
            and exit immediately, a notification is still shown to indicate which proxy server
            was set.</li>
        <li>Better exception handling.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v1.0.60802 (02/08/2006)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial Release.</li>
    </ul>
