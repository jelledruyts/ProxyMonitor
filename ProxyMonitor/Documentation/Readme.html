        Proxy Monitor</h1>
    <h2>
        Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Proxy Monitor is a small application that monitors the network and auto-detects
        the internet proxy server to use.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="Images/ProxyMonitorProxyDetected.png" alt="Proxy Monitor Notification Icon" /></p>
    <p>
        See the <a href="http://proxymonitor.codeplex.com/">Proxy Monitor homepage</a> for
        the latest information.</p>
    <h2>
        Installation</h2>
    <p>
        Before this application can be used, the .NET Framework Version 2.0 must be installed.
        It is included in recent versions of Windows and available for free through Windows
        Update or at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx"
            target="_blank">Microsoft's download page for the .NET Framework</a>.</p>
    <p>
        The application can be installed by just copying it to a destination directory of
        your choice. Uninstalling is just a matter of deleting the files again – there are
        no registry settings or other external items that are modified by the application.</p>
    <h2>
        Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The application can be started as a regular application, which will make it run
        as an icon in the system notification area. When started, it will auto-detect the
        proxy server to use. It will also automatically re-detect the proxy server when
        the computer’s network address has changed.</p>
    <p>
        You can right-click the icon to manually set the proxy server or to trigger an auto-detection.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="Images/ProxyMonitorSetProxy.png" alt="Proxy Monitor Menu" /></p>
    <p>
        The application can also be run from the command-line with the /detect flag to auto-detect
        the proxy and exit immediately (e.g. when the computer starts up).</p>
    <h2>
        Configuration</h2>
    <h3>
        General Structure</h3>
    <p>
        The application must be configured to include the definitions of the known proxy
        servers. This involves changing the ProxyMonitor.exe.config XML file in a text editor.
        The structure of the file and a sample configuration file are explained below.</p>
    <p>
        At the root, the <code>&lt;proxyConfiguration&gt;</code> element defines the general
        Proxy Monitor configuration settings.</p>
    <p>
        Beneath it, the <code>&lt;proxyServers&gt;</code> element defines all known proxy
        servers in separate <code>&lt;proxyServer&gt;</code> elements. This group defines
        your general Local Area Network (LAN) settings that apply to your normal network
        settings.</p>
    <p>
        If you have additional connections such as dial-up or Virtual Private Network (VPN)
        connections for which you want to specify different proxy servers, you can optionally
        define a <code>&lt;connections&gt;</code> element, which contains a list of <code>&lt;connection&gt;</code>
        elements that contains the same <code>&lt;proxyServers&gt;</code> structure as above.</p>
    <h3>
        Proxy Monitor Configuration</h3>
    <p>
        The general Proxy Monitor configuration element <code>&lt;proxyConfiguration&gt;</code>
        has the following attributes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>pingTimeout</code>: the maximum time (in milliseconds) a proxy detection should
            take; if none of the configured proxy servers has responded within this time, no
            proxy server is selected. The default is 3000 milliseconds.</li>
        <li><code>disableNotifications</code>: allows you to disable all proxy change notifications
            (balloon tips) by setting the value to <code>true</code>. The default is <code>false</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Proxy Servers</h3>
    <p>
        Each proxy server (either within or outside a <code>&lt;connection&gt;</code> element,
        but always in a <code>&lt;proxyServers&gt;</code> element) must be represented as
        a <code>&lt;proxyServer&gt;</code> element with the following attributes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>name</code>: the friendly name of the proxy server. This will show up in the
            context menu of the application icon in the notification area.</li>
        <li><code>host</code>: the IP-address or host name of the proxy server.</li>
        <li><code>port</code>: the TCP port to use on the proxy server. The default is port
            80.</li>
        <li><code>bypassForLocalAddresses</code>: set to <code>true</code> to bypass the proxy
            server for local addresses, or <code>false</code> to always use the proxy server.
            The default is <code>true</code>.</li>
        <li><code>bypassList</code>: set to true to bypass the proxy server for local addresses,
            or false to always use the proxy server (defaults to true).</li>
        <li><code>autoConfigUrl</code>: set this to the url of an automatic proxy configuration
            script, if available.</li>
        <li><code>command</code>: the command (DOS command, batch file, ...) to execute if this
            proxy is used.</li>
        <li><code>skipAutoDetect</code>: skips auto-detection of this proxy server, so that
            it can only be set manually through the context menu.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Only the <code>name</code> and either the <code>host</code> or <code>autoConfigUrl</code>
        attributes are mandatory.</p>
    <h3>
        Connections</h3>
    <p>
        Each connection must be represented as a <code>&lt;connection&gt;</code> element
        with the following attributes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>name</code>: the name of the connection as defined in the Internet Options
            dialog of your system (this must be exactly the same name).</li>
        <li><code>detectionDelay</code>: the time in milliseconds to wait before starting detection
            of the proxy servers in this connection. This can be useful if you have a connection
            that takes a while to get set up before the proxy servers become "visible" (e.g.
            VPN networks with security checks that take some time to complete).</li>
        <li><code>skipAutoDetect</code>: skips auto-detection of all proxy servers in this connection,
            so that they can only be set manually through the context menu.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Important to note is that the connections are checked in sequence, so if you have
        a connection with a detection delay then the next connection won't be checked until
        after the delay and the detection have completed.</p>
    <h3>
        Example Configuration</h3>
    <p>
        A sample configuration file looks as below.</p>
    <p>
        It defines two different proxy servers for the LAN: a Home and a Work proxy server.
        The Home proxy is on a machine called "homeproxy" at port 8080. The Work proxy has
        an automatic configuration script located at "http://workproxy/autoconfig.pac" and
        if this one is detected, a "ConnectToShares" batch file is executed.</p>
    <p>
        A separate connection is also defined for a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection.
        It has a proxy server specific to the VPN connection, and an alternative proxy server
        that is not automatically detected but can be manually selected if needed for some
        reason. The automatic detection is delayed for 5 seconds to allow a security check
        to complete.
    </p>

&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;configSections&gt;
    &lt;section name="proxyConfiguration"
      type="ProxyMonitor.Configuration.ProxyConfiguration, ProxyMonitor" /&gt;
  &lt;/configSections&gt;
  &lt;proxyConfiguration pingTimeout="3000" disableNotifications="false"&gt;
    &lt;proxyServers&gt;
      &lt;proxyServer name="Home"
        host="homeproxy"
        port="8080"
        bypassForLocalAddresses="true"
        bypassList="server1;server2" /&gt;
      &lt;proxyServer name="Work"
        autoConfigUrl="http://workproxy/autoconfig.pac"
        command="ConnectToShares.bat" /&gt;
    &lt;/proxyServers&gt;
    &lt;connections&gt;
      &lt;connection name="VPN" detectionDelay="5000"&gt;
        &lt;proxyServers&gt;
          &lt;proxyServer name="VPN Work"
            autoConfigUrl="http://workproxy/vpn_proxy.pac" /&gt;
          &lt;proxyServer name="VPN Work (Alternate)"
            autoConfigUrl="http://workproxy/vpn_proxy_alt.pac"
            skipAutoDetect="true" /&gt;
        &lt;/proxyServers&gt;
      &lt;/connection&gt;
    &lt;/connections&gt;
  &lt;/proxyConfiguration&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>
    <h2>
        How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        When the application is started or when the network address has changed, each configured
        proxy server is checked to see if it is available by attempting to download the
        <code>autoConfigUrl</code> or by sending a ping command to the <code>host</code>
        machine. When the download succeeded or a ping reply is received, the proxy server
        will be used and optionally the <code>command</code> is executed.</p>
    <p>
        If you have also defined <code>connections</code>, the same process is followed
        but any detected proxy server will only be set for the specified connection.</p>
    <h2>
        What's New?</h2>
    <h3>
        v1.3 (October 11, 2009)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Thanks to David Huntley, the proxy servers are now set using the proper Windows
            API's instead of writing directly to the registry. This means that setting the proxy
            now works properly under all circumstances. Thanks a million David!</li>
        <li>Also added by David Huntley is the support for connections, so you can specify proxy
            servers for specific connections such as dial-up or VPN connections.</li>
        <li>The ping timeout setting is now used to control the timeout for the entire proxy
            detection. Previously, it was only used for an actual ping request but even in that
            case, it did not include a 15 second timeout for a DNS query. So now the entire
            check is guarded with a timeout.</li>
        <li>The proxy detection is now performed on a background thread so the user interface
            is not blocked.</li>
        <li>For troubleshooting purposes, information and error messages are now logged to a
            ProxyMonitor.log file (which is configurable in the ProxyMonitor.exe.config file).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        v1.2 (September 8, 2008)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the <code>skipAutoDetect</code> attribute to support proxies that are only
            set manually.</li>
        <li>Fixed the bug where Interet Explorer would override the proxy settings again (at
            random) to their previous values.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        v1.1.0 (September 9, 2007)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the <code>bypassList</code> attribute to support the proxy bypass list.</li>
        <li>Added the <code>disableNotifications</code> attribute to allow disabling notifications
            (balloon tips).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        v1.0.60905 (September 5, 2006)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The configured proxy servers are now checked in parallel to speed up proxy detection.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        v1.0.60807 (August 7, 2006)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A custom command can now be executed when the proxy server is set.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        v1.0.60805 (August 5, 2006)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Besides pinging the <code>host</code>, the <code>autoConfigUrl</code> attribute
            of the <code>proxyServer</code> element is now used to determine if the proxy server
            is reachable by attempting a download of the configuration script.</li>
        <li>As a result, the <code>host</code> attribute of the <code>proxyServer</code> element
            is now optional.</li>
        <li>When starting the application with the /detect flag to auto-detect the proxy server
            and exit immediately, a notification is still shown to indicate which proxy server
            was set.</li>
        <li>Better exception handling.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        v1.0.60802 (August 2, 2006)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial Release.</li>
    </ul>
